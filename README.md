ScreenTask
==========

About
-----

This Programm consists of a Java App that regularly takes screenshots and a webserver that shows the newest screenshot.

History
-------

* The [Java App](https://github.com/ahmadomar/ScreenTask) was developed by [ahmadomar](https://github.com/ahmadomar) (discontinued).
* The predecessor is a [C# App](https://github.com/EslaMx7/ScreenTask) by [Eslam Hamouda](https://github.com/EslaMx7) (only bug fixes).
* [I](https://github.com/HoffmannP) updated the WebUI that refreshes the screenshots and the java App.

Features
--------
* Share your screen inside a network without internet connection (no TeamViewer anymore)
* WebUI so clients don't need any additional software (only a web browser)
* Make your session private using basic authentication (user/password)
* Works on Windows, Linux and Mac

Screenshots
-----------
![Show only a selection of the full screen](screenShots/1.png)
* You can select to only view a selection of the full screen
* Update the refresh cycle independent from the server (shouldn't be greater thant the servers)
